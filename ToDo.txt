lol who plans anyway

cellCountCheck doesn't update its text every generation

Check to make sure that all cells are following the official rules of the game; they appear to, but it is 
hard to tell.

Possibly add controls where the user can control the size of the board and of each cell, and how many
starting cells there are.

User can place initial cells??

Adjust settings labels and entry boxes to line up and look better, and add buttons to send the information 
of the text box into the system.
